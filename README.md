# My Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio, where I introduce myself, showcase my projects, and provide contact information.

## Project Structure

The project has a simple and clean structure:

- `index.html`: The main file containing the structure, content, and styles (CSS).
- `imgs/`: Directory containing the images used in the site.
    - `pp.jpg`: Profile picture.
    - `github.png`: GitHub icon.
    - `linkedin.png`: LinkedIn icon.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of the site.
- **CSS3**: Responsive design and styles integrated within the HTML file.

## Sections

1. **About Me**: A brief introduction about my profile as a developer.
2. **Projects**: A space dedicated to showcasing my work and collaborations.
3. **Contact**: Direct links to my professional networks (LinkedIn and GitHub).
